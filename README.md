The Breast Cancer AI Research Project Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Classifiers repository includes classifiers made with Tensorflow, Caffe, Keras, Intel Movidius (NCS & NCS2) and OpenVino. We aim to create projects in Python, Java, C++, R etc and compare results to find out which types of classifiers are more accurate.

# Python Classifiers

This repository hosts a collection of classifiers that have been developed by the team using the Python programming language. These classifiers include Caffe, FastAI, Movidius, OpenVino, pure Python and Tensorflow classifiers each project may have multiple classifiers.
